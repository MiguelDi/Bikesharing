### Questions raised:
- Why is there a considerable drop in bike use for Wednesday afternoon/evening's rush hours when compared to other weekdays?
- Why is there a considerable increase in Thursday afternoon/evening's rush hour when compared to other weekdays?
- Why are males more likely to be subscribers than females?
- Why are the vast majority of "unknown" riders in their mid 50's?
- Why is here is a sharp uptik of subscribers in their mid 50's then a rapid decline of subscribers for those in their mid 40's?
